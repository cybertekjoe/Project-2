# Red vs. Blue Project
The purpose of this project was to practice the roles of a pentester and SOC analyst.
- Find vulnerabilities / exploits to gain access to a vulnerable Apache web server.
- Analyze ELK logs for Indicators of attack and to identify the type of attacks.
- Documentation of findings to create a presentation on the assessment, analysis and hardening of the vulnerable system.
